 Angular Component Life Cycle Hooks / Events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-> A component in Angular Application has a life-cycle, it gone through differnet different phases from creation to destory.

-> We can also add some logic in these phases if required.   

-> To do this we add some methods to our component class which get called during each of these life-cycle phases, we call those methods hooks.

-> We can aslo refers these hooks as life cycle events.

Life Cycle Events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~	
1. constructor	
2. ngOnChanges()
3. ngOnInit()
4. ngDoCheck()
5. ngAfterContentInit()
6. ngAfterContentChecked()
7. ngAfterViewInit()
8. ngAfterViewChecked()
9. ngOnDestroy()
---------------------------------------------------------------

1.  constructor()		---  inject services

2.	  ngOnChanges	---	  trigger when we change input property values	

3.   ngOnInit				---	  trigger after constructor
											
											eg:  reading route parameters, fetching data from db using services.
											
											this.empsArray =  response.data;
											
4.   ngDoCheck		---	  change detector --- data binding properties.  It will be invoked when the change detector of the given component is invoked.  


5.   ngAfterContentInit 	
		-- Invoked after Angular performs any content projection into the components view. 
		
6.   ngAfterContentChecked 
		-> It will be invoked each time the content of the given component has been checked by the change detection mechanism of Angular.
		
7.   ngAfterViewInit 
	-> It will be invoked when the componentâ€™s view has been fully initialized --- includes all children and grand children.

8.   ngAfterViewChecked  
	-> It will be invoked each time the view of the given component has been checked by the change detection mechanism of Angular.

9.  ngDestroy 		-->	  tirgger when the component is unloading 	
							--> This method will be invoked just before Angular destroys the component.
